4. **Outstanding Tracking**: System shows which items are still pending return
5. **Mixed Condition Returns**: Handle items in different conditions within same return
6. **Cumulative Fee Tracking**: Track all fees across multiple returns
7. **Final Return Validation**: Verify all items returned before closing rental

### Customer Management Rules
1. **Unique Identification**: Each customer must have unique mobile/email
2. **Multiple Contact Methods**: Support multiple phones/emails per customer
3. **Customer Type Classification**: INDIVIDUAL vs BUSINESS with different validation
4. **Credit Limit Management**: Business customers have credit limits
5. **Customer Blacklist**: Prevent transactions for blacklisted customers
6. **Customer Tier Benefits**: Apply tier-specific discounts and services

### Inventory Management Rules
1. **Status Flow Enforcement**: Items must follow defined status transitions
2. **Serial Number Uniqueness**: Globally unique serial numbers for high-value items
3. **Multi-Location Stock**: Separate tracking by location
4. **Condition Grade Tracking**: A/B/C/D grading affects pricing
5. **Inventory Holds**: Temporary holds with automatic expiry

### Transaction Processing Rules
1. **Availability Check**: Real-time inventory verification before sale/rental
2. **Payment Before Delivery**: Full payment required before handover
3. **Security Deposit Collection**: Required before rental (30% value or ₹5,000 minimum)
4. **Pre-Rental Inspection**: Mandatory with photo documentation
5. **Buffer Time**: 4-hour buffer between consecutive rentals

## Data Models & API Integration

### Complex Workflows
1. **Partial Return Scenario**: Customer rents 3 items, returns 2 on time, 1 late with damage
2. **Rental Extension**: Customer requests extension for some items while returning others
3. **Damage Assessment**: Item returned defective - determine customer fault and costs
4. **Multi-Location Transfer**: Move inventory between stores with approval workflow

## Success Metrics
